
CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.0.0 ALPHA 2
 
 
IMPORTANT: I recommend you to make a new instance for this build, because layout stuff that got destroyed by Alpha 1 does not get repaired
 
---------------
 
- Added: Debug overlay (press CTRL + ALT + D while in a menu)
- Added: Support for web images to the "Image" menu background type
 
- Changed: "Change Anchor on Hover" (anchor overlay in editor) is now disabled by default
 
- Fixed: Rare crash when loading into a world
- Fixed: Old v2 custom GUIs don't get correctly converted to v3
- Fixed: Custom locals not working
- Fixed: Old v2 custom buttons not working (actions don't get loaded)
- Fixed: Old v2 layouts do not appear in "Recently Edited" list in "Manage Layouts" context menu
- Fixed: When saving a layout, elements sometimes get saved with wrong base width and height (if advanced sizing is used for example)
- Fixed: Image element width gets incorrectly loaded in the editor (leads to saving image elements with wrong width if the layout gets saved)
- Fixed: Element order of v2 layouts broken
- Fixed: Copyright widget hidden if it got hidden via v2 layout
- Fixed: Some Vanilla buttons customized via v2 layouts don't get all their customizations applied correctly
