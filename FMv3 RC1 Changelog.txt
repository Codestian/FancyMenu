 
CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.0.0 CLOSED BETA 1 / RELEASE CANDIDATE 1
 
- Animations are now FULLY deprecated!
--> APNGs exist now (and maybe videos soon), so there's no real need for animations anymore
--> It's not possible to add new Animation elements to layouts, but existing ones still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as game intro anymore, but existing animation intros still work for now
--> Animations can't get set as button background anymore, but existing animation button backgrounds still work for now
 
- Improved the Anchor Overlay
--> It should hopefully work much more stable now (*knock on wood*)
--> Hopefully no phantom anchor lines anymore
--> Added lots of new accessibility options to customize the overlay
----> Customizable overlay colors
----> Customizable overlay opacity
----> More visibility modes (Disabled, When Dragging Elements, On Key Press, Always Visible)
----> Customizable hover charging time (the time needed until the anchor of an element gets changed when hovering anchor areas and elements)
----> Toggleable hovering for anchor areas and elements (if the anchor of elements should change when hovering anchor areas and elements; can be toggled separately for areas and elements)
 
- Improved the Debug Overlay
--> The overlay is now categorized and categories can be toggled on/off
--> Formatted some text parts to make them more visible / easier to notice
 
- It is now possible to pre-load specific resources
--> Accessible via Customization Menu Bar -> Customization -> Pre-Load Resources
--> Recommended for APNGs used as game intro
 
- GIFs and APNGs now start playing INSTANTLY without showing its first frame until they are fully loaded
--> Web sources still show nothing for a short time, because they need to download the image first
--> Since they start playing while still loading, the first loop could stutter a bit (low framerate), because the image can't load its frames fast enough
 
- The game intro now fades to the Title screen like the loading overlay (can be toggled off)
 
- Added: Placeholder "Max Number" that returns the greater of two numbers
- Added: Placeholder "Min Number" that returns the smaller of two numbers
- Added: Placeholder "Absolute Number" to get the absolute (positive) value of a number
- Added: Placeholder "Negate Number" to negate a number
- Added: Placeholder "pi" that returns the double value that is closer to pi than any other
- Added: Placeholder "Trigonometric Sine" to calculate the trigonometric sine of an angle
- Added: Placeholder "Hyperbolic Sine" to calculate the hyperbolic sine of a double value
- Added: Placeholder "Trigonometric Cosine" to calculate the trigonometric cosine of an angle
- Added: Placeholder "Hyperbolic Cosine" to calculate the hyperbolic cosine of a double value
- Added: Placeholder "Trigonometric Tangent" to calculate the trigonometric tangent of an angle
- Added: Placeholder "Hyperbolic Tangent" to calculate the hyperbolic tangent of a double value
- Added: Placeholder "Current Time in Millis (Unix Timestamp)" to get the current time in milliseconds, measured by the time that has elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970
 
- Fixed: It is possible to remove/reset the Forced GUI Scale of a layout without disabling Auto-Scaling first, which can lead to the layout scaling the menu to infinity
- Fixed: "Pick Element" in element right-click menu not working correctly
- Fixed: Elements in the editor sometimes get de-selected when moving multiple elements at once (using CTRL + left-click)
- Fixed: When moving multiple elements by arrow keys, elements with ELEMENT anchor point move wrong if parent element is selected as well
- Fixed: When moving multiple elements by mouse, elements with ELEMENT anchor point don't move if parent element is NOT selected as well
- Fixed: Menu bar entry to toggle the editor grid does not update its label if the grid gets toggled via shortcut (CTRL + G)
- Fixed: Appearance delay + fade-in not working correctly for Vanilla widgets
- Fixed: Missing alpha/opacity handling for ImageButtons like the Language and Accessibility buttons (this is a Vanilla bug)
- Fixed: Fade-in not working correctly for Slider elements
- Fixed: Fade-in feature of the element appearance delay can be enabled while appearance delay is disabled (this still works in multi-select menus and will probably stay like that)
