CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.7 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]
 
- For developers:
  - It's now possible to control if elements, placeholders, loading requirements, actions and menu backgrounds should show up in their "Add" menus
    - This for example makes it possible to allow elements/placeholders/requirements/actions/backgrounds only for specific types of screens
  - You can now control if universal layouts should get applied to specific types of screens
  - Visibility and active state suppliers for ContextMenus are now stackable
  - You can now control the visibility of FancyMenu's customization overlay (without, for example, completely blacklisting a screen)

CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.6 [ W I P !! NOT PUBLIC YET !! ]

- Dropped support for MC 1.20.4
- Ported to MC 1.20.5
- Removed option to toggle the header/footer shadow of scroll lists in MC 1.20.5+
- Removed option of Custom GUIs to toggle the dark transparent background overlay that used to get rendered when in a world, because it no longer exists in MC
- MC 1.20.5+ renders a dark background overlay in scrollable screens and FancyMenu respects this overlay and renders custom backgrounds BEHIND this overlay
  - This avoids difficult to read scroll list items
  - This overlay can be removed with a resource pack ("textures/gui/menu_list_background.png" and "textures/gui/inworld_menu_list_background.png")
- I noticed a strange bug (?) that bricks the target screen when leaving the editor, so you get redirected to the Title screen for now, because that seems to fix it
- Added an option to MC 1.20.5+ to render the dark screen background overlay rendered by Vanilla Minecraft on custom screen backgrounds (disabled by default)
