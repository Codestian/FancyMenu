CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.2.3 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- The layout editor now opens the target screen again when closing the editor in MC 1.20.6+
- Minimized the changes the layout editor does to Vanilla widgets, so they are less likely to be broken when leaving the editor
- Fixed game crash when opening the Create World screen while customizations are enabled for that screen in MC 1.20.6
- Fixed customized Vanilla widgets show as uncustomized in the editor despite having a layout open that customizes said widgets in MC 1.20+ (maybe 1.19+)
- Fixed some of FancyMenu's screens crashing the game (like the Choose Resource screen) in MC 1.20.6
