CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.8 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]

- Added support for FMA (FancyMenu Animation) files, which is a new animated texture format created for FancyMenu
  - This format is very similar to FM's old animation format, but it's now a single file and has very similar features as GIF and APNG images
  - FMA files have no audio support, because it's an animated texture format (there will be video support for that in the future)
- There's now a "modpack mode" that disables all overlays and hotkeys to toggle overlays
  - You need to manually enable this mode by setting "modpack_mode" to "true" in "/config/fancymenu/options.txt"
- For developers:
  - It should now be possible to access all of FancyMenu's registries in the mod init phase (Fabric, Forge & NeoForge) without any problems
  - It's now possible to control if elements, placeholders, loading requirements, actions and menu backgrounds should show up in their "Add" menus
    - This for example makes it possible to allow elements/placeholders/requirements/actions/backgrounds only for specific types of screens
  - You can now control if universal layouts should get applied to specific types of screens
  - Visibility and active state suppliers for ContextMenus are now stackable
  - You can now control the visibility of FancyMenu's customization overlay (without, for example, completely blacklisting a screen)
- Fixed Ticker element not saving its tick delay value
