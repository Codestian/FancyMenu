CHANGELOG | FANCYMENU v3.1.8 [ W I P !! Not public yet !! ]
 
- For developers:
  - It's now possible to control if elements, placeholders, loading requirements, actions and menu backgrounds should show up in their "Add" menus
    - This for example makes it possible to allow elements/placeholders/requirements/actions/backgrounds only for specific types of screens
  - You can now control if universal layouts should get applied to specific types of screens
  - Visibility and active state suppliers for ContextMenus are now stackable
  - You can now control the visibility of FancyMenu's customization overlay (without, for example, completely blacklisting a screen)
